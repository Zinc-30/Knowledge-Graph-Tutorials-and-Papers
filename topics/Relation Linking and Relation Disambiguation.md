## Linking and Disambiguation of Relational Phrases

__Relation Linking__
1. Matching natural language relations to knowledge graph properties for question answering (ReMatch, SEMANTICS 2017)
2. Capturing knowledge in semantically-typed relational patterns to enhance relation linking (SIBKB, K-CAP 2017)

> * Relations are pre-defined based on the target knowledge base.
> * Neural networks are applied to automatically encode sentence semantics, which is a powerful way to model large-scale noisy text.

> * J-REED is based on probabilistic graphical models that captures the interdependencies between entities and relations.
> * J-REED consides which lexical types of entities are compatible with the type signature of which relation (but the experiments are only conducted on the PERSON-type entities).
